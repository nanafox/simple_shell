# MSH (Minimal Shell)

MSH is a minimalistic shell implementation that provides a basic command-line interface with enhanced features. This README outlines the various functionalities supported by MSH.

### Change Directory (`cd`)

The `cd` command is built into MSH, allowing users to change the current working directory. Simply enter `cd [directory]` to navigate to the specified directory. If `[directory]` is omitted, the current user's `$HOME` directory is  used. This `cd` also handles the `-` argument that's passed to the `cd` command. For example, when
the command is `cd -`, the shell changes directory to the value of `$OLDPWD`, which is the last directory the user
visited before their current working directory.

---

### Alias and Unalias

MSH supports aliasing commands for convenience using the `alias` command and removing aliases with `unalias`. This enables users to create shorthand notations for commonly used commands. Currently handles only one command (without arguments) as the value of the alias.(Future updates will make it more dynamic)

#### Usage:

```bash
alias cls='clear'
alias md=mkdir

unalias cls # remove the 'cls' alias
```

---

### Logical Operators (`&&` and `||`)

Logical operators `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) are supported in MSH. They enable users to execute commands conditionally based on the success or failure of previous commands.

#### Example:

```bash
command1 && command2
command1 || command3
```

---

### System Commands

MSH allows the execution of system commands. Enter any system command directly in the shell prompt to run it.

#### Example:

```bash
ls -a
cat /etc/passwd
mkdir src
```

---

### Exit Command

The `exit` command, built into MSH, is used to exit the shell gracefully. It takes **positive** exit codes

#### Example:

```bash
exit
exit 1 # exit with status code 1
```

---

### Setenv and Unsetenv

The `setenv` and `unsetenv` commands are utilized to set and unset environment variables, respectively. This feature enhances the customization of the shell environment.

#### Example:

```bash
setenv MY_VARIABLE my_value
unsetenv MY_VARIABLE
```

---

### File as Input

MSH can take input from a file, allowing users to execute a series of commands from a script.

#### Example:

```bash
msh script.txt
```

---

### Comments

Comments can be added to MSH using the `#` symbol, allowing users to annotate their commands without affecting execution.

#### Example:

```bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, MSH!"

ls # this will list the contents in the current working directory
```

---

### Variable Expansion

MSH supports variable expansion, including `$$` (current process ID) and `$?` (exit status of the last executed command).

#### Example:

```bash
echo "Process ID: $$"
command
echo "Exit Status: $?"
```

---

### Command Separator (`;`)

The semicolon (`;`) acts as a command separator in MSH, allowing users to execute multiple commands on a single line.

#### Example:

```bash
command1 ; command2
```

---

### Custom Env

Custom command `env` is available to display the current environment variables.

#### Example:

```bash
env
```

---

### PATH

MSH uses the `PATH` environment variable to locate executable files. Ensure the desired directories are included in the `PATH` for seamless command execution.

---

### Commands with and without Arguments

MSH supports commands with and without arguments, providing flexibility in command execution.

#### Examples:

```bash
ls
ls -l
```
